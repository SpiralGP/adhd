        <h2>Bespoke Commission..</h2>
      <figure>
        <p>Commissions can come in all shapes and sizes,

            no job can be too big for perfection.
            
            If you have a design, or an idea and need a metalsmith to bring it in to fruition then you are in the right place.
            
            Commissions are a great way to make a statement, show off and leave a lasting impression to anyone who sets eyes on your adornment.
            
            Commissions are a personal reflection of yourself to your taste and needs
            
            and will always be as unique as you.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <img src="../ADHD/img/bg.webp" alt="Background Image">
        <h4>A Breif History</h4>
        <p>Asher David was born in London in 1987 – the year of the Great Storm. And it is true to say that he did ‘storm’ into the world with a whirlwind of energy, which has always been difficult to contain. His passion for designing started as a child. He learnt through doing, so using his hands to create came naturally to him. He excelled in Design Technology and Art – Asher could make things!

        "I could see designs in my ‘mind’s eye’ and then would just create".
            
        However, the education system failed him, as he felt confined in a world of needless rules and lack of understanding of his need to move; to express and be free. Eventually, it was recognised that Asher has 'Attention Hyperactivity Disorder' otherwise known as (ADHD).</p>

        <h4>Inspiration and Quotation</h4>
        <p>"I have found myself drawn to the inspirational work of Dukno Yoon and Bobby White.
        The agency of their designs brings to me a sense of fun, play and fascination.
        I am fascinated not only by how they are made, the materials and the design elements but also by the thoughts and feelings of the designers whilst making them".
            
        "This is the relationship and the gravity between them...
        ...the jewellery and me."
            
        "Therefore, my aim is for my designs to bring that fascination to others".</p>

        <h4>About the shop</h4>
        <p>​
            Items in the shop vary from ADHDesign repeated stock to one-off pieces.
            
            if an item says SOLD then we can recreate another of your choosing.
            
            Please be aware that the colour of stones may vary due to sourcing new and similar ones for the job.
            
            Please note it could take up to 4 to 8 weeks to recreate an item through re-sourcing of new materials and re-making it by hand, the piece will be similar but not identical as we do not mass produce through casting, we appreciate your patience and understanding.
            
            Commission filter - shows what has been sold to commission, if you would not like your personal commissioned jewellery to be displayed here for a fear of being duplicated then please let us know and we will keep it a secret. 
            
            One Off's Filter - shows one-off pieces that can not be repeated due to being the only one ever made at an earlier stage of ADHDesigns history and or do not have the ability to duplicate due to equipment shortages for certain processes and or material shortages like hand cut stones that cant be duplicated.
            
            Every Other Filter - can be made to order straight from the shop, please allow between 2 to 4 weeks depending on size, weight and hallmarking as each item is individually handmade to order.
            
            Thank you and happy shopping :)</p>
